# flickrate

flickrate is a different way to look at the statistics for you flickr photos.
On their statistics page, flickr tracks the top ten photos in terms of all time cumulative
views.  But after a while, this list rarely changes, because older photos keep accumulating
views and newer ones can never catch up.  I was interested in which of my more recent
photos were doing well, so I wrote flickrate.  This program will show you which of your
photos are getting more views per day, which should allow recent photos a chance.


To use flickrate, you'll need an API key and secret from flickr.  You can get one
[here](https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/noncommercial/?).
